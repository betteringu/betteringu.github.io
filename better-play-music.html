        <h2>Better Play Music</h2>
        <p>Like Spotify, but Better.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of ways this can go down - I am a huge proponent of open-sourcing everything, 
        but I understand that some people are really obsessed with getting people to pay money for things that are already available for free.</p>

        <p>Let’s start on easy-and-less-controversial-mode and say that we will charge people $7 a month for a membership. 
        Like Spotify but cheaper because of course our prices are better.</p>

        <p>I tend to think that transparent accounting and decentralization make things better.</p>

        <p>In this case, that would mean that any business we conduct is done via smart contracts backed up to a blockchain - likely Ethereum via L2s and/or L3s. 
        (We can backup the important info across EVERY blockchain/DeFileSystem.)</p>

        <p>The money paid every month would in turn give more weight to that Being’s attention - 
        since it is less likely that a paid account will be used for botting.</p>

        <p>We can then track all of the music this Being pays attention to over the course of the month.</p>

        <p>We evenly distribute tokens from that Being to each song they were listening to.</p>

        <p>The attention tokens accrued to a song are directly proportional to the payout the Artist(s) receive for that song.</p>

        <p>BPM (and the rest of >ᛝ) will implement myriad different schemas for helping Artists make money off of their Art.</p>
