        <h2>Better Search</h2>
        <p>Google is dead and we need a new word for searching the ingternet instead of saying that we will “google” it.</p>

        <p>I propose that the funniest term is to say that you’ll “BS” it (or were BS-ing it).</p>

        <p>Better Search could work in a number of ways - one possible way is as a “meta” search engine.</p>

        <p>These are not new, but they are so unappreciated and unpopular that they might as well not exist. Perhaps with Better Branding, people might take notice?</p>

        <p><a href="https://docs.searxng.org/index.html" target="_blank">SearXNG</a> recursively searches through a wide variety of engines and then summarizes them all 
        in order to provide a less biased search (and keeps your privacy more protected).</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, the BS >ing can encapsulate a huge number of search strategies. 
        The important part is that you get to decide for yourself which you think is better, and you can use whichever version you prefer.</p>

        <p>The solution to scary black box algorithms is to give people the option to choose which they prefer.</p>
