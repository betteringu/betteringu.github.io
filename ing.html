        <h2>Everything is an ing</h2>

        <!-- Picture 1 will go here -->
        <img src="images/picture1.png" alt="Representation of ing" />

        <p>The ing is symbolically represented as the unification of Better and Worse (>+< = ᛝ).
        Thus the ING can also be referred to colloquially as the BetterWorse.</p>

        <p>No matter how far you zoom into the quantum soup, the smallest thing you will find is still a thing.</p>

        <p>ings are the building blocks of things.</p>

        <p>If you zoom out into multi-dimensional space and find the highest possible point of perspective - 
        that perspective which encapsulates literally everything - I call that the ᛝ ING ᛝ.</p>

        <p>I’m not here to debate theoretical theology but I imagine the ᛝINGᛝ to be the highest point of the “godhead”.</p>

        <p>It’s ings all the way down and all the way up.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the Ingter Net Graph is to map the interconnectedness of every thing.</p>

        <p>Most ings and Ings will be focused only on things relevant to themself, but in understanding the ING, 
        it is best to look at the EVERY ING.</p>

        <!-- Link to Picture 2 -->

        <p>The ING is composed of ings, things, and strings. An ing is the abstract concept of a thing.</p>

        <p>A String is a line between things - symbolizing a relationship.</p>

        <p>There can be as many different types of strings as there are ings.</p>

        <p>Ings are like subreddits, only better because they are more general.</p>

        <p>r/memes does not actually contain a link to every known meme.</p>

        <p>The meme-ing is not a meme but rather the abstract concept of memes. 
        Any thing on the internet which is considered a meme will have a string tying it to the meme-ing.</p>

        <p>ings don’t actually exist - they are the abstract concept of themselves.</p>

        <p>For example, the `gangnam style` ing is not the song gangnam style but the abstract concept of gangnam style. 
        Every thing which has any ing to do with `gangnam style` will have a string connecting the two together.</p>

        <p>ings can be thought of as “spiritual objects” with invisible strings drawing the relationship between that ing 
        and every other ing it has a relationship with.</p>
