        <h2>Better Statistics</h2>
        <p>I haven’t put much thought into this aspect of BS apart from a vague awareness that there will eventually be 
        a coordinated effort to have Better Statistics about… everything.</p>

        <p>The world of data is convoluted and tends to be held behind paywalls because companies want money for data, 
        and if they gave it away for free they would go broke. Oops.</p>

        <p>This aspect of >ᛝ can get creepy and Orwellian, but if that happens at least we can try to get Better 
        (but it’d be better to just get it right on the first try, let’s do that instead).</p>

        <p>The repercussions of having a public ingternet is that once the data is up there, it’s hard to forget.</p>

        <p>If we are mapping literally anything that happens relative to a particular person, there are a lot of things 
        we include—like private medical history, location data, text message history, etc.—that people WOULD NOT WANT 
        SAVED TO THE PUBLIC INGTERNET.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we don’t always get what we want, and it is inevitable that we will eventually see this happening 
        more and more, especially as immutable decentralized file systems become popular.</p>

        <p>How we handle this will be important, I think.</p>
