        <h2>Better Science</h2>
        <p>The way we “do” science has gotten screwed over by big scientific journals keeping everything hidden behind paywalls. 
        Science requires a baseline level of transparency and freedom of information.</p>

        <p>As we build a Better and Better Ingter Net Graph, we will populate it with more and more scientific data for BS to access and do its BS to.</p>

        <p>I am not a scientist, and I imagine many scientists would have Better Ideas than I could on how the Better Science-ing ought to operate. 
        This is great news—please call all of the people obsessed with the “philosophy of science” so we can have them debate and test their ideas 
        on the Better way for Better Science to be.</p>
