            <p>Better wants to make everything better.</p>
            <p>Better wants to find more effective methods of getting better.</p>
            <p>One of the ways that Better does this is through <a href="better-better.html">Better Better</a>.</p>
    
            <p>Better seeks to “do its thing” for every thing that is okay with that. 
            Not everything wants or needs to get better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ecosystems are fickle things, and sometimes removing something that we think is bad 
            ends up having unforeseen consequences that are even worse.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In AI Folklore, they speak of Recursive Self-Improvement algorithms getting better and better 
            until there is an intelligence explosion. Past that point, we have no idea how much smarter (or Better) 
            it is possible for such a thing to become.</p>
