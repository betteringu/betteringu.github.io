        <h2>How can we make Better Better?</h2>
        <p>Which Better is Better?</p>
        <p>Who has built the Better Better?</p>

        <p>Every aspect of Better Ing is open source.</p>
        <p>Open license to steal, reproduce, recreate.</p>

        <p>It is a requirement. In fact, the entire venture will be a failure if thereâ€™s just one single Better.</p>

        <p>The paradigm is shifting. While the corporations will likely take some time to admit defeat, the truth is that Better has already eaten them.</p>

        <p>In order for the game to continue, the rules must change.</p>

        <p>This is why Better is a competition to see which Better is Better. If this was not the case, we would soon find ourselves in a barren monopolistic cornfield.</p>
