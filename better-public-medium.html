        <h2>Better Public Medium</h2>
        <p>Aims to become the Better Public Medium for accessing media and interacting with other beings.</p>

        <p>There will be an unlimited number of ways of interacting with things and beings on the ING.</p>

        <p>There will be many different “flavors” of BPM to choose from, from theoretically any source, 
        as otherwise this would be a boring monopoly that everyone is upset with.</p>

        <p>Iron sharpens iron and competition is the best way for BPM to get better.</p>

        <p>Since the EVERY-ING aims to encapsulate literally every-ing, all of the posts on all other platforms 
        can be indexed by the ING and thus will be available via BPM.</p>

        <p>Like Youtube or Spotify, but better because you can access every video or song on the ING.</p>

        <p>Like Facebook, Instagram, or X, but better because it is platform agnostic and recursively encapsulates all of the other platforms.</p>
